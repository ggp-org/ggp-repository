A two player game with alternating play in which, in each round,
each player has the option to either continue or finish. If a player
finishes, the game ends immediately. Otherwise, the game continues.
The payoffs are constructed so that the decisions are as follows:

Let [x,y] denote a payoff of 'x' to White and 'y' to Black.

1. White decides whether to finish at [5,0] or continue.
2. Black decides whether to finish at [0,15] or continue.
3. White decides whether to finish at [15,10] or continue.
4. Black decides whether to finish at [10,25] or continue.
    (etc)
17. White decides whether to finish at [85,80] or continue.
18. Black decides whether to finish at [80,95] or continue.
19. The game finishes at [95,90].

Conventional game theory suggests that rational players will finish
the game immediately. To see why this is the case, consider Black's
final move: a decision between 95 points and 90 points. A rational
player will finish rather than continue. Assuming that Black will
finish on move 18, then by similar logic White will finish on move 17,
to get 85 points rather than 80, and so on, until White must logically
choose to finish on move 1.
